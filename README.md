# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Isabelle HeuzÃ©

I am a Theoretical Physics Graduate from Trinity College Dublin, passionate about Quantum Computing.

I mainly work using Python but I have a few projects in C++. 
My Python experience includes quantum computing frameworks, such as Qiskit, Pennylane, and CirQ.

I would love to collaborate on anything quantum related!
